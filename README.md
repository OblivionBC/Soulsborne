# Soulsborne Game

## What is this?

This is a solo project to make a Soulsborne (Elden ring eqsue) game in C++ using Unreal Engine 5.4. More specifically I am using this project to become more familiar 
with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) in Unreal Engine which is a powerful framework for handling complex gameplay mechanics such as abilities, state management, and effects.

Thanks for checking it out!

##Disclaimer
I do not own any of the assets including but not limited to meshes, animations, and particles. 
Howvever I do own the Source Code and Implementations used in this project, please do not copy them, but feel free
to learn from them or use similar methods if it helps! :)

## Acknowledgements
- To implement this I used Traneks GAS documentation to learn the system, I highly reccommend it :)
