# Soulsborne Game

## What is this?

This is a solo project to make a Soulsborne (Elden ring eqsue) game in C++ using Unreal Engine 5.4. More specifically I am using this project to become more familiar
with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) in Unreal Engine which is a powerful framework for handling complex gameplay mechanics such as abilities, state management, and effects.

Thanks for checking it out!

## Acknowledgements

- To implement this I used Traneks GAS documentation to learn the system, I highly reccommend it :)
